<p>New York Nunchucks: Nunchucks Are Legal in New York After 45 Year Ban Overturned - Jan. 28, 2019
Guest: James M. Maloney, Adjunct Professor, State University of New York Maritime College
The two short sticks attached with a chain were one of Bruce Lee’s signature weapons. New York officials made it illegal to possess nunchucks in 1974 because of reports they’d become popular with muggers and street gangs. But a lawyer nicknamed “Professor Nunchucks” by comedian Stephen Colbert, has just succeeded in getting the ban overturned. A court said last month it violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms and state officials let the deadline to appeal the ruling expire. So nunchucks are back in New York

Spider Goats: Milk from Genetically-Modified “Spider-Goats” is Source of Valuable Silk
- Feb. 7th 2019
Guest: Justin Jones
Spider silk is stronger than steel, super lightweight and surprisingly elastic. If we could make it in bulk, it’d be great for everything from parachutes and sports gear to replacement tendons and ligaments. Which is why the US Navy has been investing for years in a lab at Utah State University that’s figured out how to coax the building blocks of spider silk out of goats and alfalfa and even E. coli bacteria.

Digital Piracy: Why a Little Piracy Might be Good for Everyone - Feb 14th 2019
Guest: Antino Kim, business Professor, Indiana University
Do you share a Netflix password with someone or have a teenager in the house who watches their favorite shows for free from a pirate website? Look, we all know piracy is wrong, but in the digital age it’s just so easy. Hollywood studios and retailers like Netflix and Amazon spend a lot of money and time playing whack-a-mole with digital pirates. Maybe they should relax a bit.

Shrimp Shells: Shrimp Shells May Be the Key to Renewable Energy - Feb. 20th 2019
Guest: Robin Rogers, PhD, Research Professor of Chemistry, University of Alabama, Founder of 525 Solutions
If you're an American fan of shrimp, you probably take the shells off before you eat them. In the US, that outer layer usually gets thrown away or sold as fertilizer. But one chemist believes the shrimp shell may soon be worth more than the meat inside.

Wildlife Forensics: Poop-Seeking Dogs Work to Save Endangered Orcas - Mar. 6th 2019
Guest: Deborah Giles, Vessel Captain for this Project, University of Washington’s Center for Conservation Biology
Since orcas in the Pacific Northwest were placed on the endangered species list more than a decade ago, their status hasn’t improved. No one was quite sure why. That is, until sniffer dogs hit the water and found scientific gold: killer whale feces. How do you train a dog to sniff scat on the open sea?

Mugshot Extortion: Online Public Mugshots Have Become a Controversial Business
- Mar 13th 2019
Guest: Sarah Lageson, Rutgers School of Criminal Justice
You know those mugshot websites you see advertised online? We’re so intrigued –for some reason –by seeing how people look in a police camera. Well, just imagine, for a moment, that you or your kid end up arrested. Maybe you’re never even charged with a crime after the dust settles, but your mugshot is now in the public record. And thanks to one of those mugshot websites, it’s now the first thing that pops up when someone Googles you. What a way for a prospective employer to meet you online, eh?

Sharenting: When to Post about your Children Online: The Effects of Sharenting
- Mar 20th 2019
Guest: Stacey Steinberg, Law Professor, University of Florida’s Levin College of Law
If you love to share pictures, videos or funny stories about your kids on Facebook or Instagram, there’s a name for that –it’s called “sharenting.” And you’re not alone. Most kids today have an online presence from birth –even before then, if their parent post sonogram pics on their social feeds. And what’s your kid going to think when they’re old enough to Google their name and discover everything you’ve put online about them?

Bee Math: Honeybees Have Tiny Brains and Can Learn to Do Basic Math –So Brain Size Doesn’t Matter? - Mar 21st 2019
Guest: Scarlett Howard, Postdoctoral Researcher at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France
In the animal kingdom, the human brain is biggest, relative to our body size. And when it comes to smarts, size matters. Except researchers are discovering that’s not always true. Scarlett Howard taught honeybees –with teeny-tiny brains –how to do basic arithmetic. Not calculus, mind you. But still, if a bee can learn to add or subtract one, maybe there’s a lesson there for big-brained humans trying to teach robots to be artificially intelligent?

Beard History: What Do Beards Tell us about Politics, Culture and Religion?
- Mar 28th 2019
Guest: Christopher Oldstone-Moore, Senior Lecturer Assistant to the Chair for Graduate Studies, Wright State University, Ohio
Anytime a celebrity or politician comes back from a break sporting facial hair, people kinda freak out. Senator Ted Cruz’ new salt-and-pepper beard was an obsession for weeks online. And have you seen David Letterman since he left the Late Show? He’s giving Santa Claus a run for his money. What’s the big deal with facial hair? Whether a man shaves –or doesn’t –is his business.

Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures: Not All Seizures Are from Epilepsy, Psychotherapy Helps Sufferers of Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures - Apr 10th 2019
Guest: Benjamin Tolchin, Neurologist, Yale School of Medicine
If someone has seizures, they must have epilepsy, right? Turns out, more than five percent of patients diagnosed with epilepsy actually have something else called "psychogenic non-epileptic seizures" or PNES. That means thousands of people are getting the wrong medical treatment, and that can have serious consequences.

Movie Trailers: Who Makes Movie Trailers? - Apr 17th 2019
Guest: Nick Temple, Founder and Creative Director, Wild Card
The latest movie trailer everyone’s talking about is Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker. Star Wars fans are on fire with speculation: Is Luke Skywalker coming back? And Emperor Palpatine? A good trailer teases, and that one’s done its job. Making these tantalizing bites of filmispure seduction.

Tipping Culture: Restaurants Are Trying to Fix a Broken System by Banning Tips
- Apr 23rd 2019
Guest: Saru Jayaraman, Co-Founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC United), Director of the Food Labor Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, Author of “Forked: A New Standard for American Dining”
Here in the US, diners are expected to tip their server at a sit-down restaurant. But if you’ve travelled abroad, you know that’s not really true in most other places. And there’s a movement here in America to get rid of tipping, too. Some say it’s unfair to other workers at the restaurant, or that it encourages discrimination or that it’s just antiquated.

Misophonia: Chewing, Chomping and Slurping Cause Intense Discomfort to Those with Misophonia - Apr 30th 2019
Guest: Jeffrey Gould, Director/Producer of “Quiet Please”
Eating noises are gross. I would try to beat my siblings to breakfast growing up because I couldn’t stand the sound of chomping and slurping cold cereal. I’d hurry and eat quickly –making my own slurping noises I’m sure –so I wouldn’t have to hear my brother and sisters making their noises.

Scientific Names: What’s in a Scientific Name? Rights to Name New Species Are Sold at Auctions to Promote Conservation - May 7th 2019
Guest: Douglas Yanega, Entomologist, University of California, Riverside, Assistant Editor-in Chief of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
With enough money, you can get a sports stadium, or a university building named after you. If you eat at a local deli every day, you might get a sandwich named in your honor. How would you like to have a new insect with your name on it? Usually the naming rights go to the person who discovers the bug, but lately museums and conservation groups have been putting those rights up for auction to raise money.

Kids in the Spotlight: Charity Empowers Foster Youth by Teaching Filmmaking Skills - May 14, 2019
Guest: Martin Johnson, Program Director at Kids in the Spotlight
More than 440,000 children are currently in the US foster care system–and that number keeps going up every year. Foster kids have no stability, and are less likely to go to college, but a California non-profit program called Kids in the Spotlight hopes to build their confidence and success by teaching them filmmaking.

Annie MOORE: New Technology Helps Resettle US Refugees to Find Better Employment Opportunities - May 21, 2019
Guest: Karen Monken, Director of the Reception and Placement Program at HIAS
Those of us born in the United States are incredibly lucky. Around the world, people forced from their countries by war and poverty cling to the hope that they’ll somehow manage to be one of the roughly 25,000 refugees chosen to relocate in America each year. Just getting here is the dream. Often, they have no choice in wherein the United States, they’ll be sent. Those decisions are made by the handful of nonprofits in the US tasked with resettling refugees. One of them called HIAS has lately been experimenting with making those decisions using intelligent software.

Gender and Toys: Gender-Specific Toys Can Limit Opportunities for Children to Learn and Grow - May 30, 2019
Guest: Lisa M. Dinella, Principal Investigator of the Gender Development Laboratory, Monmouth University
When you walk down the toy aisle at any store, you’ll usually find the aisle divided into pink and blue: on the pink side there are Barbies, tea sets, and princesses. On the blue side you’ll see cars, superheroes, and nerf guns.

Right to Repair: Break it, You Buy it: Right to Repair Laws Push to Make DIY Product Repair Cheaper and Easier - Jun 6, 2019
Guest: Nathan Proctor, Director, Campaign for the Right to Repair at the United States Public Interest Research Group
When you go to a phone store, you’ll see iPhones, Samsung Galaxies, and phone cases lining the walls. What you won’t see available for purchase are parts to fix phones. No screens, no circuit boards, no fix-it-yourself manuals. The Right to Repair Campaign at the US Public Interest Research Group says that picture is wrong.

Local Journalism: Communities Benefit from Local News, but Journalism Is on a Decline - Jun 11, 2019
Guest: John Temple, Associate Adjunct Professor and Director of the Investigative Reporting Program, UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism
The Great Recession ten years ago accelerated a trend that the internet had set in motion a decade earlier –the decline of local newspapers. Those that made their money off classifieds withered thanks to Craigslist. Then advertisers shifted to the web. There are more than a thousand communities around the country that have lost all local media coverage during this shift, but the majority of Americans –according to a Pew Research survey –think local media is doing just fine.

The World Hum: Have You Heard the Hum? Several Theories Try to Explain This Mysterious Noise (16:37) - Oct 11, 2019
Guest: Glen MacPherson, Director of the World Hum Map and Database Project
All around the world, people claim to hear a persistent low humming noise that’s sometimes known as the World Hum. Not everyone can hear it. Just some people. The noise usually follows them wherever they go. Glen Macpherson built a steel box to see if he could block out the humming. But even inside of it, the noise was there. MacPherson is not a conspiracy theorist –though there are plenty of those chasing down the world hum. MacPherson’s take is more scientific. He’s a high school science and math teacher and director of the World Hum Map and Database Project which is trying to solve the mystery of the Hum. (Originally aired June 4, 2019)

Muslim Marine: Muslim Marine strives to change American misunderstandings towards Islam - Jun 13, 2019
Guest: Mansoor Shams, Muslim U.S. Marine Veteran, Founder of MuslimMarine.org
Mansoor Shams has visited 25 states with a handwritten sign that says, “I’m a Muslim and a US Marine. Ask Me Anything.” Apparently, a lot of people are surprised those two things can go together. Since the 9/11 terror attacks, American Muslims have struggled to overcome stereotypes about Islam. Mansoor Shams founded his nonprofit MuslimMarine.org to improve understanding and promote dialogue –like how he stands on a street corner and invites people to ask him tough questions.

Thermostats and Gender: Cold office temperatures harm women’s productivity, study finds - Jun 24, 2019
Guest: Tom Chang, Associate Professor of Finance and Business Economics, USC Marshall School of Business
Summer is sweater-season for women who work in office buildings. I’ll sometimes get into my sweltering car after work and just revel in the heat for a moment after being in the chilly office all day. Most buildings are set to the ideal temperature for the metabolism of a typical male, which different from a typical female. But it’s not just a matter of comfort. Economist Tom Chang at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business found, in some recently-published work, that women perform better when they’re not shivering at their desks.

The Public and GMOs: Good or Bad? Researchers Join Together to Shift Public Perception of Genetically Modified Foods - Jul 2, 2019
Guest: Stacey Stearns, GMO Project Coordinator, University of Connecticut
About half of Americans say they avoid eating food that’s been genetically modified. But what that really means is that they don’t realize what they’re eating. Virtually everything on the grocery store shelf contains genetically modified ingredients. Corn oil, corn syrup, soy protein –all comes from crops with DNA engineered to grow better or resist certain pests. The fact that so many people think they’re steering clear of GMOS when they’re not, underscores how poorly the public understands the facts about genetic modification and food.

Art Restoration/Murals: Bringing Street Murals Back to Life - Aug 19, 2019
Guest: Scott Haskins, Director and Chief Conservator, Fine Art Conservation Laboratories
Colorful street art seems to have taken on new life thanks to Instagram. Tourists will make a special pilgrimage to an out-of-the-way spot just to get that perfect photo in front of an artsy mural. Scott Haskins is the guy cities call when graffiti, pollution or weather damage an iconic street mural. Recently his team has been restoring famous art along Los Angeles free ways that have all but disappeared beneath graffiti.

Roadside Attractions: Why World’s Largest Things Dot American Roadsides
- Sep 5, 2019
Guest: Erika Nelson, One of America’s Foremost Experts and Speakers On the World’s Largest Things
If you’re driving past Winlock, Washington, you might catch a glimpse of the world’s largest egg. Or if you’re on your way through Woodruff, Wisconsin, you can stop to get a picture in front of the world’s largest penny. Large versions of normal things having been popping up all across the United States for decades, bringing curious road-trippers and inspiring other large things in other, usually smaller, cities.

Killing a Volcano: Finding fake volcanoes and dealing with the real ones - Sep 11, 2019
Guest: Janine Krippner, PhD., Volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institute Volvanologist Program and host of the Popular Volcanics podcast
There are fewer volcanoes today than there were just a few weeks ago thanks to people like volcanologist Janine Krippner. She works at the Smithsonian and one of her jobs is to sniff out imposters on the official list of volcanoes. Yes, there’s an official list. And best beware if you’re a volcano-wannabe, cause Krippner has no qualms killing your dream.

Hawaii Snail Extinction: David Sischo fights to Save Hawaiian Snails from Extinction - Sep 12, 2019
Guest: David Sischo, Snail Extinction Prevention Program (SEP) Coordinator with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources
One is the loneliest number. And if you’re the last one of you’re the last of your kind, you’re not just lonely, you’re on the verge of extinction. That was the sorry fate of George –a Hawaiian tree snail, the last known member of his species. He died in January after spending all 14 years of his life in a captive breeding facility that was trying to save his species.

Moon Landings: India Moon Landing Fails. What makes going back to the moon so difficult?
Guest: Ryan J. Kobrick Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Spaceflight Operations at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
India had hoped to have a remote-controlled lander trundling toward the Moon’s south pole right now. But just before the lander touched down on the moon’s surface a few weeks ago, it lost contact with India’s space agency and now it’s laying on its side up there, not responding to communication from Earth. Earlier this year Israel had a similar experience when their spacecraft failed at the last minute

Playgrounds: The Evolution of Playground Design and its Effect on Children
- Sep 18, 2019
Guest: Alexandra Lange, is a Design and Architecture Critic and Author of “The Design of Childhood: How the Material World Shapes Independent Kids”
I miss merry go rounds. You hardly find them on playgrounds anymore. On the one hand playgrounds are much cooler than they were when I was a kid. But they also feel less risky. I’ve wondered if the design of playgrounds affects how kids develop.

Kidnapping Insurance: In the Surprisingly Organized World of Kidnapping for Ransom, Insurance Companies are Key
- Sept 25, 2019
Guest: Anja Shortland, Professor in Political Economy, King’s College London, and Author of “Kidnap: Inside the Ransom Business”
You’ve probably got a bunch of insurance –for your house, your car, your health, maybe even your life. Ever heard of kidnap insurance? There’s a surprisingly organized industry built around kidnapping people for ransom globally. The companies that provide insurance against the possibility that you’ll get kidnapped for ransom play a strange and important role, according to research of Anja Shortland.

About Fresh: About Fresh puts grocery stores on wheels to fight food deserts - Oct 1, 2019
Guest: Annika Morgan, Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of About Fresh
There’s a nonprofit in Boston that loads up school buses with fresh produce and sells it at a discount in neighborhoods that lack grocery stores. Doctors in the community even hand out gift cards for the fruits-and-veggies-school-bus to patients who need a healthier diet. They’re literally prescribing food as medicine. Annika Morgan is co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of the nonprofit, called About Fresh

Swamp Apes: Veterans Hunt Invasive Florida Pythons - Oct 9, 2019
Guest: Tom Rahill, Founder, Swamp Apes
Florida’s Everglades are crawling with thousands of Burmese Pythons, and they’re destroying the ecosystem. It’s such a huge problem that the state government has turned to bounty hunters to track down pythons and kill them. Tom Rahill is an IT guy by day and a snake hunter by night. But for him, it’s about more than the money or saving the Everglades-its therapy. Rahill believes python hunting especially helps veterans and runs a non-profit called Swamp Apes to bring them along.

Little Free Library: Little Free Libraries Bring Free Books to Neighborhoods Near You - Oct 7, 2019
Guest: Margret Aldrich, Media and Programming Manager at Little Free Library, Author of "The Little Free Library Book"
You may have come across a birdhouse-shaped box with books inside and a sign that says, “Little Free Libraries.” There are 90,000 of them in 91 countries. Take a book, leave a book. This year marks ten years since the project started as a way for a book-lover to honor his school-teacher mother. What surprises me is that this whole project has flourished in the digital age when you’ve got endless reading material on the phone in your pocket. Who wants to pick from a handful of random books available in a box on someone’s lawn?

Water Sommelier: Water Sommelier Martin Riese stays hydrated professionally
- Oct 7, 2019
Guest: Martin Riese, Water Tasting Educator, Water Sommelier at Petit Ermitage Hotel in West Hollywood
When you go on vacation, can you taste the difference in the tap water? It might be subtle, but I can. And Martin Riese definitely can. He’s a professional water taster –a water sommelier, even. At the Petit Ermitage Hotel in West Hollywood he oversees a menu of waters and recommends pairings for diners. Which, I know, sounds so LA.

Climbing Trees: Connecting with Nature through Professional Tree Climbing - Oct 14, 2019
Guest: Tim Kovar, Founder of Tree Climbing Planet
Most of us stopped climbing trees a long time ago. I was never good at it as a kid, either, honestly. But Tim Kovar never stopped, and now spends his time coaxing adults back into the branches. He’s a master tree climbing instructor and founder of Tree Climbing Planet.

Proving Einstein Right: Proving Einstein Right: The Daring Expeditions that Changed How We Look at the Universe
- Oct 16, 2019
Guest: Sylvester James Gates, Jr., Theoretical Physicist, Brown Theoretical Physics Center Director, Co-Author of "Proving Einstein Right: The Daring Expeditions that Changed How We Look at the Universe"
100 years ago, a total solar eclipse changed our understanding of the universe and made Albert Einstein famous. Up till then, Einstein was just an academic with some intriguing ideas about gravity. But a group of adventurous astronomers set out to test Einstein’s theory of relativity. To do that, they needed to take pictures of the stars during total solar eclipses. And to do that, they had to travel to Russia on the brink of war and deep into Brazil’s Amazon jungles. Finally, on May 29, 1919, after eight years of failed attempts, astronomers captured the evidence they needed to prove Einstein was right.

Timber Poaching: How to Catch a Tree Thief: Timber Poaching in the Pacific Northwest
- Oct 21, 2019
Guest: Anne Minden, Retired Special Agent with the US Forest Service, President of Minden and Associates, LLC
Animal poaching is a problem you’re familiar with. But did you know that people also poach trees? Timber thieves will take chainsaws onto forest service land, bring down a Douglas fir or a big leaf maple and make hundreds of dollars selling the wood to a sawmill or a furniture manufacturer. Anne Minden is one of the handful of people who track down tree-robbers.

The HALO Trust: Removing Landmines and Empowering Communities at the HALO Trust (34:01)
- Oct 23, 2019
Guest: Chris Whatley, Executive Director, HALO USA
Imagine if a field near your house was littered with hidden landmines and unexploded ordnance from a war that’s over, but nobody cleaned up after. So every day, you worry that your kidsmight stray off the safe path, stumble on a landmine and end up injured, or worse. That’s a reality parents live with in dozens of countries around the world, including Angola, which Britain’s Prince Harry recently visited. Landmines are an unhealed scar of war. By clearing the landmines, we can help this community find peace and with peace some opportunity.” Prince Harry was following in the footsteps of his mother, Princess Diana, who helped spark global action on landmine removal with her advocacy. The HALO Trust is a leading nonprofit working on this issue across Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Asia and the Middle East. Anywhere there’s been a protracted war, leftover landmines are a problem.

Clam Gardens: Clam Gardens Provide Stable Food and Unite Generations for Indigenous Groups in Pacific Northwest (51:10) - Nov 4, 2019
Guest: Skye Augustine, Clam Garden Project Coordinator at Parks Canada
Thousands of years ago, indigenous people living in the Pacific Northwest had an ingenious way of cultivating clams for food diet. As America was colonized and tribes were displaced, those farming techniques were abandoned. But clam populations along the West Coast are suffering today, so there’s an effort underway to help indigenous groups reclaim the “clam gardens” their ancestors built along the shoreline. Skye Augustine is heading up one such project for the national parks system in Canada.

Food Deserts: Why Grocery Stores Don’t Help Communities in Food Deserts to Stay Healthy (51:05) - Nov 5, 2019
Guest: Kelseanna Hollis-Hansen, PhD Candidate at the University at Buffalo and Graduate Research Assistant at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences
In places sometimes referred to as “food deserts” healthy food options are farther and more expensive than normal. The obvious answer would be to just put up another supermarket. But researchers at the University at Buffalo found that new grocery stores actually lead to a decrease in people eating their fruits and veggies.

Fog Harvesting: In Arid Regions, the Fog Harp Gets Water from Thin Air (18:17)
- Nov 6, 2019
Guest: Brook Kennedy, Industrial Designer and Professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute’s School of Architecture + Design
More than one billion people around the world live where water is scarce. Another billion face water shortage because their country doesn’t have the proper infrastructure for water gathering. And the United Nations predicts it’s only going to get much worse in the coming years. That means we have to find new sources of H2O. So how about using fog? A couple researchers figured out how to more effectively harvest that eerie mist for drinkable water.

Meditation Detention: The Holistic Life Foundation Teaches Schools to Replace Detention with Meditation (51:09) - Nov 12, 2019
Guest: Ali Smith, Executive Director of the Holistic Life Foundation
Students who disrupt class or get into fights are usually sent to detention, but some schools in Baltimore are using a different technique--meditation. They’ve teamed up with a non-profit called the Holistic Life Foundation that runs mindfulness programs to help bring calmness into the classroom. And it seems to be working—these schools have lower suspensions and higher grades.

Asteroid Fossils: Life after the Asteroid: Fossils Show How Mammals Thrived after the Extinction of the Dinosaurs (1:11:55) - Nov. 13, 2019
Guest: Tyler Lyson, Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, Denver Museum of Nature & Science
66 million years ago, an asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula and caused a catastrophic mass extinction. It wiped out the dinosaurs, but not much was known about what happened to the survivors of the impact until recently. A team of paleontologists have discovered a treasure trove of fossil remains allowing them to piece together a vivid picture of life’s recovery after the dinosaurs.

Apollo 12: 50th Anniversary of Apollo 12 (32:11) - Nov. 18 2019
Guest: Mike Joner, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Brigham Young University
You couldn’t miss the 50th anniversary celebrations of Apollo 11 over the summer. Everybody knows Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to walk on the moon. You ever heard of Pete Conrad and Alan Bean? They landed on the moon just four months later. At this very moment 50 years ago, the crew of Apollo 12 was about to touch down on the lunar surface. So, we’re going to pay a little tribute to the men who were 3rdand 4thon the moon.

FIREX-AQ: NASA and NOAA’s FIREX-AQ Project Sends Scientists to the Sky to Study Wildfire Smoke (37:53) - Nov 19, 2019
Guest: Carsten Warneke, Mission Scientist and Primary Mission Contact at NOAA’s FIREX-AQ Project
As wildfires burn bigger and hotter across the US, what’s happening to air quality? When the massive Camp Fire was burning last year in California, people across the whole northern part of the state experienced dangerous breathing conditions because of the smoke. This year, a team of scientists from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA flew planes right into wildfire smoke plumes to get a better handle on this growing form of air pollution.

Free Agency in Sports: Sports Wars: How Free Agency Changed the Business of Pro Sports (1:14:51) - Nov 20, 2019
Guest: James W. Quinn, Sports Lawyer, Author of “Don’t Be Afraid to Win: How Free Agency Chagne the Business of Pro Sports”
Male professional athletes in America are making more money than ever. Forbes says the highest earners of 2019 are NFL quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers who both have salaries just north of $80-million. Next on the list are NBA stars Steph Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant who all have salaries in the $30-40 million range but make at least as much in endorsements. Fifty years ago, all five of those star athletes probably would have needed a side job to make ends meet during the off-season. What changed?

David’s Harp Foundation: Nonprofit Teaches Kids to Write and Produce Music in Exchange for Good Grades (51:11) - Nov. 26, 2019
Guest: Brandon Steppe, Founder and Executive Director at The David’s Harp Foundation
There was a point about 15 years ago when Brandon Steppe set out to become a rapper and music producer. He even built a recording studio in his garage. And then a visit from a neighbor kid, changed everything. Today, Steppe runs a nonprofit called the David’s Harp Foundation in San Diego. He mentors disadvantaged young people and gives them free access to his recording studio. But to earn studio time, kids have to get good grades.

International Post: Why Having Stuff Shipped from China is So Cheap –and How That’s About to Change (51:08) - Dec. 2, 2019
Guest: Anna Möller Boivie, Managing Director of Copenhagen Economics in Stockholm
Savvy online Christmas shoppers may have noticed that postage-wise, it’s cheaper to order a gift from China and have it sent directly to your relative in a neighboring state than it is to buy that same thing at a store in town and mail it yourself. It makes no sense that having something shipped from China would be cheaper than shipping it to another state unless you understand the workings of a group called the Universal Postal Union. Just before this holiday season got underway, the US government went to that international group demanded some big changes –which they mostly got. So starting next summer, the postage for stuff you buy online from overseas will go up. But you’re good for the holiday season.

Humanitarian Forensics: Humanitarian Forensic Scientists Identify the Dead after Disasters (1:06:21) - Dec. 3, 2019
Guest: Stephen Cordner, Professor of Forensic Pathology at Monash University and Head of the International Programmes at Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine
In any humanitarian response –whether it’s for a natural disaster or a war –the focus is primarily on the survivors. Unfortunately, there are usually also the dead to attend to. Fifteen years ago, the International Committee of the Red Cross recognized the need to formalize that part of the humanitarian response and created something known as “humanitarian forensics.”

Stand-up Economics: You Know You’re a Standup Economist if...You’re Yoram Bauman (1:26:22) - Dec 5, 2019
Guest: Yoram Bauman, Standup Economist, Co-Author “Cartoon Introduction to Economics” and “Cartoon Introduction to Climate Change”
Yoram Bauman travels the country trying to make people laugh at college gatherings and corporate events. He introduces himself as the “world’s first and only standup economist.” Jokes about economics can be tricky, but if you get the right crowd, Bauman kills. And there’s enough demand for economist jokes that this has been Bauman’s full-time gig for a decade.

Red Kettle Campaign: How the Salvation Army’s Red Kettles Became a Christmas Icon (34:44) - Dec 12, 2019
Guest: Diane Winston, Associate Professor and Knight Center Chair in Media & Religion, University of Southern California, Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism
The Salvation Army bell-ringers are out in force with their red kettles, collecting donations for charity. Did you know the Salvation Army started out as a British evangelical church? So how did its bell-ringers become such an iconic, primarily American, Christmas-time tradition? Diane Winston wrote a book about it called “Red-Hot and Righteous: The Urban Religion of the Salvation Army.”

Soup and Malaria: There’s Wisdom in Tradition: Some Soups Can Help Fight off Malaria (22:59) - Dec 19, 2019
Guest: Jake Baum, Professor of Cell Biology and Infectious Diseases at the Imperial College London
There’s that saying about feeding a fever and starving a cold. Or maybe it’s the other way around? For some reason lots of cultures have some sort of hot brothy soup that’s fed to sick people. It was mainly just for comfort, I thought. But what if there is something medicinal in that traditional chicken noodle or miso or matzo ball or pho?

-----WINTER 2020-----

Carbon Tax:Carbon Taxes Appeal to Economists, but Do They Work? (34:06) - Jan. 8, 2020
Guest: Yoram Bauman, PhD, environmental economist, co-founder of Clean the Darn Air, Standup Comedian
The latest climate change report from the UN is bleak. Without drastic, immediate – and frankly unprecedented - cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures will rise as much as 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Six degrees doesn’t sound like much when you’re thinking about your thermostat at home. But for the planet, it means the oceans become too acidic for coral to survive. Fish die off. Coastal cities flood constantly. Heatwaves become unbearable. Storms become more intense. And Yoram Bauman thinks economics is the answer.

Space Fire: Don’t Light a Fire on the International Space Station…Unless it’s for Science (1:03:06) - Jan 8, 2020
Guest: Richard Axelbaum, Professor of Environmental Engineering Science, Washington University in St. Louis
To make a fire, you need fuel, heat and oxygen. Since all three are easy to find on Earth, fire is common. But in space, there’s no oxygen, so no fire. Except on the International Space Station where astronauts are deliberately setting fires. Why? For science, of course.

Coral Reefs and Sound: Scientists Lured Fish Back to Dying Coral Reefs with Loudspeakers (21:58) - Jan 9, 2020
Guest: Tim Gordon, Marine Biologist, PhD Student, University of Exeter
The world’s coral reefs are in dire straits. Extreme heat killed off half the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 and 2017. Those damaged areas of coral became like a ghost town. But if fish could be drawn back to the reef, their very presence could trigger other parts of the coral ecosystem to come back, too. Marine biologist Tim Gordon has struck on an ingenious strategy to lure fish to patches of dead coral – sound.

International Impeachment: Impeachment is a “Hard Reset” Button in Other Countries, but not the USA (50:37) - Jan 14, 2020
Guest: Tom Ginsburg, Professor of International Law, University of Chicago
After a month’s delay, the public gears of impeachment are turning again Washington. The US House will vote Wednesday to send its arguments in favor of impeaching President Trump over to the Senate for trial. The Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to remove President Trump from office.
America is not the only country that allows for impeachment of a President, but the way it works here is fairly unusual – and maybe not ideal.

Pet Detective: Pet Recovery Specialist on How to Find Lost Dogs (1:18:24)
Guest: Babs Fry, Pet Recovery Specialist, Founder of A Way Home For Animals
It’s a pet owner’s nightmare, but it happens to millions of people every year. Your dog or cat slips through an open door or gap in the fence or darts away from the sitter and suddenly you’re in panic mode, canvassing the neighborhood, calling out for your pet. And that’s exactly the opposite of what you should be doing.

Identifying Soldiers: DNA Helps Identify Service Members Missing in Action from WWII to Today (20:32)
Guest: Timothy McMahon, Director of DNA Operations, Department of Defense
The Department of Defense has an entire office dedicated to DNA analysis that regularly brings closure to families of servicemembers missing in action all the way back to World War II. One project focused on the attack on Pearl Harbor has been able to identify 250 unaccounted-for service members from remains that were collected from sunken American warships.

Living Concrete: Living Concrete: Scientists Create Bacteria-Based Buildings that Grow Themselves (1:23:35)
Guest: Chelsea Heveran, Assistant Professor of Engineering, Montana State University
Smart homes are all the rage these days, but what if your house were alive? Not haunted, but alive in the sense that the building materials in the walls and floors contained living organisms that could regrow and repair themselves? Chelsea Heveran was part of a team developing a kind of living concrete made of sand and bacteria and some other special ingredients.

Nuclear Sleuths: Publicly-Available Satellite Data Helps Regular Citizens Monitor Secret Nuclear Development in Iran and NK (35:15)
Guest: David Schmerler, Senior Research Associate, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey
North Korea and Iran have both recently said they plan to renew their efforts at developing nuclear weapons. Understanding just where those countries currently stand with nuclear capability has traditionally required skills and sources only a government agency would have access to. But these days anyone can go on Google Earth and see virtually any spot on the planet in reasonable detail. Researchers at the Middlebury Institute’s James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies have developed an impressive reputation for sleuthing nuclear secrets using satellite images and other publicly-available information.

Social Impact of Robots: When Robots Take Our Jobs, Humans Might Become Less Prejudiced Toward Others (1:11:21) - Jan 28, 2020
Guest:  Joshua Conrad Jackson, PhD student, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
In industrial nations around the world–like the US and UK–immigrants are often blamed for stealing the low-wage jobs from native-born citizens. That’s been the refrain for much of the last century. In this next 100 years, though, it’ll be robots taking our jobs. Will having a common robotic enemy make us less inclined to discriminate against people we used to see our main threat? That’s one vision of the future, at least.

Lawless Oceans: Crime is Tough to Catch on the High Seas (37:04) - Feb 3, 2020
Guest: Karsten von Hoesslin, Head Detective, Remote Operations Agency
The world’s hunger for fish is depleting ocean fisheries, so countries and international organizations try to set and enforce limits on how much companies can fish out of the sea. But the incentive to cheat is so strong, that regulators can’t just trust fishing boats to be honest about what they’re up to. That’s where fishery observers come in. One man or woman from an independent organization gets assigned to go out on a ship – often for months at a time – to monitor and report anything illegal. The job is dangerous, and several fishery observers have disappeared in recent years under mysterious circumstances.

Lake Erie Bill of Rights: Should Nature Have Rights? Lake Erie’s Got a Bill of Rights (1:24:37) - Feb. 5, 2020
Guest: Tish O’Dell, Ohio Organizer at the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, President of the Ohio Community Rights Network
If corporations have individual rights under US law – like freedom of speech - why not a grant a lake or forest or river the same status?  New Zealand recognizes the legal rights of the Te Urewera forest. India considers the Ganges River a legal person. The first attempt at this in the US came last year when the citizens of Toledo, Ohio voted to give Lake Erie rights normally reserved for a person. The move is being challenged in court.

Global Worming: Jumping Worms Are Invading North American Forests (50:38) - Feb 11
Guest: Annise Dobson, Postdoctoral Researcher, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies
When Julie turns over some soil in my garden and find a wriggling pink earthworm, she gags, but fights the urge to smash it, because she knows that worms are good for soil. They break down organic matter and soften dirt so plants can grow better. Well, anyway, that’s what most of most people think. But actually, earthworms in large numbers can be problematic for plants. Plus, there’s a type of invasive earthworm making its way across North America that’s really, really bad for plants and especially for forests.

LA Car Chases: Why Can’t Los Angeles Stop Watching Car Chases? (1:00:49)
Guest: Mary Melton, Editor and Writer, Principal, Mary Melton Media
Car chases have become so common and entertaining in LA that it’s almost become a spectator sport. Friends will tell each other to turn on the TV when the news helicopter is following an intense chase. There’s even a Facebook group solely dedicated to posting about live pursuits. But these aren’t car chases in movies –these are real people in real danger. And some may be gunning it just because they know they’ll get on TV. So should car chases be televised at all?

The Mountain Messenger: Carl Butz Saves Local Newspaper (33:54) - Feb 20, 2020
Guest: Carl Butz, Retired Computer Programmer, Owner of the Mountain Messenger
The latest issue of California’s oldest weekly newspaper is on stands today – hot off the presses. Publishing a local newspaper is always a challenge, but for The Mountain Messenger, it’s basically a miracle. In mid-January, the paper was set to fold. Then retired computer programmer Carl Butz decided he couldn’t let that happen, so he stepped in with money he’d been saving to go on vacation and is now the proud owner of a small-town paper in an industry that’s dying nationwide.

Katherine Johnson: Remembering NASA Mathematician Katherine Johnson (1:21:32)
- Feb 27th, 2020
Guest: Bill Barry, NASA Chief Historian
NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson died this week at the age of 101. As an African American woman, she broke both color and gender barriers at NASA. Her calculations helped put the first Americans in space and her career featured in the book and movie "Hidden Figures."

Collaborative Archaeology: Archaeologists and Native Americans Collaborate to Understand and Protect Historic Sites (19:09) - Mar 2, 2020
Guest: Matthew Liebmann, Professor of Archaeology, Harvard University
Archaeologists have developed a reputation over the centuries of being pretty disrespectful of indigenous cultures, doing things like excavating sacred Native American burial grounds and taking bones and artifacts away to be studied and displayed in museums without any input from the tribe. Harvard University archaeologist Matthew Liebmann has spent his career trying to not do that.

Anti-Lynching Act: After More Than a Century, Congress Makes Lynching a Federal Crime (37:06) - Mar 4, 2020
Guest: Tameka Bradley Hobbs, Ph.D., Professor of History at Florida Memorial University, Author of “Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home”
A measure to making lynching a federal crime has finally passed Congress, after more than a century of failed attempts. President Trump is expected to sign the law and advocates say it’s an important symbolic step toward justice for the more than 4,000 victims of lynching – most of them African Americans. The vast majority of those murders went unpunished. And they weren’t all in the South.

First-Gen Students: First Generation College Students Face Unique Challenges, but Colleges Can Help (1:10:44) - Mar 12, 2020
Guest: Ben Gibbs, Associate Professor of Sociology, BYU; Thomas Murillo, Sociology Major, BYU
If your parents went to college and their parents went to college, you have a real advantage when it comes time for you to go to college. Your family knows how to speak the language of admissions and applications, scholarships and loans. Your parents know what “finals week” is and how it feels to carry a heavy load of credits. They know the process of choosing a major. They know the common pitfalls that can delay graduation. But today a third of American college students are the very first in their family to go to college. They’re at higher risk of dropping out before they graduate. So, many universities are developing programs intended to help first generation students succeed.

Hunting Decline: Hunting Is on the Decline in America, Conservation and Wildlife Will Suffer (50:39) - Mar 11, 2020
Guest: Samantha Pedder, Director of Operations, Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports
Fewer people are hunting in America these days, which you might think is a good thing for wildlife. But the irony is that for the last hundred years, fees from hunting licenses and taxes on hunting equipment have been the primary source of funding to wildlife protection and restoration. The need for funds to protect endangered species and restore waterways is growing, thanks to pollution, climate change and development, but revenue from hunting and fishing is declining. How to fill the gap? One way is to recruit a new generation of hunters, which is what the Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports is working on.

RecycleHealth: RecycleHealth Sends Unused Health Devices to Underserved Communities for Free (21:00) - Mar 12, 2020
Guest: Lisa Gualtieri, PhD, Assistant Professor, Tufts University School of Medicine, Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Founder Of RecycleHealth
Fitness trackers are so common, you probably have one on your wrist right now, or else it’s gathering dust in a drawer somewhere because you lost interest after a few months. That happens so often that a Tufts University public health researcher created a nonprofit to gather abandoned Fitbits and smart watches and give them new homes.

Extinct Foods: How Humans Ate Their Favorite Foods to Extinction (31:04) - Mar 18, 2020
Guest: Lenore Newman, Canada Research Chair in Food Security and the Environment, Associate Professor of Geography and the Environment, University of the Fraser Valley, Author of “Lost Feast: Culinary Extinction and the Future of Food.”
A little over a hundred years ago, the ultimate American comfort food was pigeon pot pie. Not chicken pot pie. Passenger pigeon pie. The bird was all over restaurant menus, too. And then Americans ate the passenger pigeon right out of existence. It was not the first time – nor will it be the last – that humans loved a food so much they drove it to extinction.

The Uncensored Library Lets Journalists Escape Censorship In…Minecraft? (34:30) - Mar 24, 2020
Guest: Guest: Kristin Bässe, Media and Public Relations Officer, Reporters Without Borders (RSF)
The video game Minecraft is proving popular – and useful – during the pandemic. Poland launched a public server so kids can hang out and build things with their friends in a virtual space – while keep at a safe social distance. Some Japanese elementary students missing out on their graduation, held one for themselves in Minecraft. The company that makes Minecraft is extending its educational options for teachers and students to use during the pandemic, too. On a very serious note, the international nonprofit Reporters Without Borders has just launched a public library inside Minecraft where people can go to read the work of journalists who’ve been censored, persecuted and, and in the case of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, killed for speaking against repressive regimes.

Mini-moon: Earth’s Car-Sized Second Moon Was Only Visiting (1:24:51) - Mar 25, 2020
Guest: Bill Gray, Creator of Guide Astrometry Software
Earth just lost a moon. Not the moon - a second, much smaller one, about the size of a Toyota Prius. Astronomers only discovered it orbiting our planet a month ago. Now it’s gone. Where did it go? Where did it come from? And could we get another moon someday?

South Dakota Trusts: Why the Ultra-Rich Are Putting Their Money Into South Dakota (1:20:36) - Apr 1, 2020
Guest: Oliver Bullough, Contributor to the Guardian, Author of “Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back”
Time was, the world’s super-rich would park their billions in a place like Panama, Switzerland or the Cayman Islands to avoid paying taxes. Today, they’re just as likely to send their money to the United States, and South Dakota is leading the way.

Artificial Glaciers: Manmade Ice Pyramids Compensate for Disappearing Glaciers in Himalayas (50:38) - Apr 6, 2020
Guest: Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer, Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh
The region of Ladakh, high in the Himalayas of northern India, doesn’t get much rain, so the people there have long relied on melting glaciers for water to drink and grow their crops. But the glaciers are disappearing. So the people of Ladakh are making their own mountains of ice – they look like ice castles – to store water for the spring and summer. They’re called “Ice Stupas.”

Virtual Congress: Should Congress Meet Online? (19:28) - Apr 9, 2020
Guest: Marci Harris, Former Congressional Staffer, Co-Founder and CEO of PopVox
Let’s consider now how the pandemic might change the way Congress operates. At least five members of the House and Senate have contracted COVID-19 and many others have self-quarantined because of contact with an infected individual. Is it safe for members of Congress to be traveling back and forth between their districts and the Capitol every few weeks during a pandemic? Is there a way for Congress to do its business remotely during a crisis? So far House and Senate leadership have resisted the idea of going virtual. But there are others in Congress clamoring for it.

National Emergency Library: Is the Internet Archive’s National Emergency Library Legal? (19:52) - Apr 20, 2020
Guest: Kevin Smith, Dean of Libraries, University of Kansas
Across the country, libraries are closed and, I don’t know if you’ve checked your local library’s website, but the waiting lists to borrow an e-book can be very long. Which is why the nonprofit that runs the Internet Archive has launched the National Emergency Library and removed all borrowing restrictions from its vast collection of digital books through the end of June. So, no wait lists and anyone can set up a free account with the library.  Many readers and librarians are thrilled. Many authors and book publishers are not. They’re also struggling right now with bookstores closed and book tours cancelled. Authors would much prefer you buy their e-books, obviously.

Tree Gold: There’s Gold in Them Trees: Leaves Show Where to Mine for Gold (50:40) - Apr 29, 2020
Guest: Melvyn Lintern, Geochemist, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Portable PPB, Former Scientist CSIRO, Australia’s National Science Agency
Money might actually grow on trees after all. Researchers in Australia found trace amounts of gold in the leaves of eucalyptus trees. A hundred feet below ground, under layers of dirt and clay and sand, they found – you guessed it – gold. So instead of drilling randomly to find new sources of the precious metal, could companies prospect for gold by examining tree leaves instead?

Ghost Town: Quarantined in a Ghost Town (1:25:43) - Apr 30, 2020
Guest: Brent Underwood, Marketer, Owner of Cerro Gordo
I know this sounds like a movie plot, but it’s Brent Underwood’s real life at the moment. He’s been stuck for weeks in an abandoned mining town called Cerro Gordo up in the California mountains. Well, all alone unless you count the ghosts that are said to haunt the town.

Antarctican Accent: There’s an Antarctica Accent. No, Really - May 4, 2020
Guest: Jonathan Harrington, Professor of Phonetics and Digital Speech Processing and Director of the IPS, University of Munich.
We all know what various accents sound like, British, Irish, Australian, and so on. But how about Antarctican? You heard me right. People who’ve spent months living isolated together in Antarctica have started to develop their own accent.

Atom Bombs and Whale Sharks: Studying Whale Sharks With Help From Atomic Bomb Fallout (50:40) - May 5, 2020
Guest: Joyce Ong, Fish Biologist, Postdoctoral Researcher, Rutgers University
The whale shark is the largest fish in the sea – it can grow to be nearly as long as a semi-trailer. And they’re endangered, but scientists aren’t entirely sure how to help, because, until now, we haven’t known how long whale sharks live.

Invisible Hands: “Invisible Hands” Bring Groceries to At-Risk People in New York (25:21) - May 6, 2020
Guest: Simone Policano, Actor, Film Producer, Co-Founder of Invisible Hands
New York City has been under some of the strictest quarantine rules in the country, allowing people to leave their homes only for essentials like medicine, groceries and occasional exercise. But people at high risk for COVID-19 are urged not to leave home at all. Enter Invisible Hands – a brand new nonprofit that recruits volunteers to grocery shop for housebound people.

Curved Universe: The Shape of the Universe (35:15) - May 7, 2020
Guest: Joseph Silk, Homewood Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University
I’m going to be honest, thinking about the universe too much kind of freaks me out. It’s dark, cold, and goes on forever in all directions. But my understanding of the universe could be totally wrong. Just like how we realized the earth wasn’t flat, some researchers are now thinking the same thing about the universe. It could be curved. Yeah, try to wrap your mind around that one.

Astronaut Isolation: What Tips Do Astronauts Have for Self-Isolating? (15:20) - May 12, 2020
Guest: Gregory Chamitoff, Former NASA Astronaut, Professor of Aerospace Engineering, Texas A&M University
If any profession is familiar with isolation and social distancing, it’s astronauts who spend months in confined quarters on the International Space Station. We wanted to know what that’s like and if it compares at all to the isolation so many people are enduring on Earth right now.

Debt Collection: How Debt Collectors Are Transforming the Business of State Courts (1:11:04) - May 12, 2020
Guest: Erika Rickard, Project Director, Civil Legal System Modernization Initiative, The Pew Charitable Trusts
Lawsuits going after consumers for outstanding debt have come to dominate state civil courts in recent years. Part of that is because Americans keep going further into debt. But it’s also because of the rise of the “debt-buying” industry and the fact that state courts are not designed to deal with the realities of debt claims.
