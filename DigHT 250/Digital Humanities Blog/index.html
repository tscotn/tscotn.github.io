        <p>Digital Humanities is the study of ourselves as humans in the context of and with the aid of technology.
            As a Statistics major with a minor in Design Thinking, I'm especially interested in the ways technology allows us to harness the power of data--for better or worse. 
            With the exponential improvement of computing resources and analytical methods, problems that once seemed impossible to breach are melting away.</p>
            <p>The following are a few examples of the power of data at work:</p>

                <h2>data science</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The methods related to gathering insights from data, using techniques from as simple as basic statistical analysis to as ground-breaking as Artificial Intelligence.</p>
