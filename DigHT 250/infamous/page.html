            <h2>Jeff Probst Bot</h2>
            <p>This is a bot that scrambles a set of roughly 20 using a series of if statements and random number generators...it's pretty rough, and prone to repetition. Jeff Bot's been running for almost a year, and has only accrued about 9 followers, mostly friends who were present when I was working on the project written in Python. It tweets once every afternoon.</p>

            <h2>Nobody's Talking About</h2>
            <p>The phrase "nobody's talking about" seems to pop up on Twitter every few days, usually concerning a topic that a great number of people are talking about. To track trends and see if people truly aren't talking about something, I built a bot that retweets tweets with the phrase "Nobody's talking about" every two hours. It's gained 18 followers almost entirely organically over a handful of months.</p>

            <h2>There Should Be An App</h2>
            <p>I built this bot the same day as "Nobody's Talking About" with the same idea--to track instances of people tweeting out their app ideas. Over a couple of months, I've found that a surprising number of people have had the idea to build an app to track ice cream trucks and that a lot of people don't realize their app idea already exists. So far, this is my most popular but with 29 organic followers, which seems to be growing exponentially.</p>

            <h2>Ed Yong Bot</h2>
            <p>Most of the more problematic bots just post political spam or tweet out disinformation. This bot was an effort in exploring what the process of building a bot might look like, as well as an experiment with Markov Chains. This bot generates tweets based off of a corpus of articles by the journalist Ed Yong at The Atlantic. Sometimes it produces gibberish, sometimes it's hilarious, and sometimes it's uncannily realistic. So far, my wife and I are the only followers.</p>
