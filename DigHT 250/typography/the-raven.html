                <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
                In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>
                Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
                But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--<br>
                Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--<br>
                Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
                
                <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
                By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
                "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>
                Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--<br>
                Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>
                Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."</p>
                
                <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
                Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;<br>
                For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
                Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--<br>
                Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
                With such name as "Nevermore."</p>
                
                <p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
                That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
                Nothing farther then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--<br>
                Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before--<br>
                On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."<br>
                Then the bird said "Nevermore."</p>
                
                <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
                "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store<br>
                Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
                Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--<br>
                Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
                Of 'Never--nevermore'."</p>
