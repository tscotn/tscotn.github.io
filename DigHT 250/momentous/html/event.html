            <h4>"For roughly a decade, the land snail species <em>Achatinella apexfulva</em>, which used to be plentiful on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, was believed to be down to a single survivor. His name was George, and he lived his last days alone in a terrarium in Kailua, Hawaii, alongside an ample supply of fungi (a food his ancestors liked to scrape off leaves in the wild)."</h4>

            <h4>"He was also the last known snail of his kind, the final <em>Achatinella apexfulva</em>. It is said that everyone dies alone, but that was doubly true for George—alone at the end both in his cage and in the world."</h4>
