            <p>One is the loneliest number. And if you’re the last of your kind, you’re not just lonely, 
                you’re on the verge of extinction. That was the sorry fate of George–a Hawaiian tree snail, 
                the last known member of his species. He died in January after spending all 14 years of 
                his life in a captive breeding facility that was trying to save his species.</p>
